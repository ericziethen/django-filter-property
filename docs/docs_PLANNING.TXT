### !!! HIGH LEVEL PLANNING !!!

# INDEX

   guide/overview
    - Purpose of this app (Achieve same functionality ad django-filter but for Model Properties)
    - Why Needed (property fiels, cannot be queried directly in the database)
    - Provide Matching Filters with Same behaviour
    - Inheritance Filters
    - New Filterset (supports django-filters the same as normal Filterset)

   guide/how_it_works
    - filter works directly on the queryset, propFilter builds up list of pks matching the prop filters and queries those, result still a queryset
    - processing done in memory

   guide/install
    - Pip install

   guide/usage
    - Eamples (Implicit, Explicit, Filterset, parameters)

   guide/limitations
    - most but not all expressions supported yet
    - explain filter in memory, so potentially issues for very large data sets
    - Document drawbacks of properties, unexpected file types
    - Document slower, in memory, large set, type convertions might reduce speed
    - document sqlite limitations, e.g. 999 max params limit, or higher depending on sqlite version...
    - Mention if any Filters are particular slow, like Using AllValue and AllValueMultipleChoice, document the field property to create a form and mixing filters, slow if large numbers
    - danger of unsupported, different types

Limitations
-----------

        .. warning::
            Because this app preserved Django Filtersets and filters them agains fields
            that are not Database fields all filtering happens in memory.
            Compared with direct sql optimized queries that might be slower and more
            memory intensive.

        Database Parameter Limits
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        In theory there is no limit for most databases how many results can be returned
        from a filter query unless the database implements a limit which will impact how
        many results django-property-filter can return.

        **sqlite**

        .. warning::
            Sqlite3 defines SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER which is a limit for parameters
            passed to a query.

            Depending on the version this limit might differ.
            By default from version 3.32.0 onwards have a default of 32766 while
            versions before this the limit was 999.

            See "Maximum Number Of Host Parameters In A Single SQL Statement" at
            https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html for further details.

        Django-property-filter will try to return all values if possible, but if not
        possible it will try to return as many as possible and log a warning message
        similar to::
            WARNING:root:Only returning the first 3746 items because of max parameter limitations of Database "sqlite" with version "3.31.1"

        It is possible to set a custom limit via the environment variable
        "USER_DB_MAX_PARAMS". For example the user uses a custom compiled sqlite
        version with a different than the default value for SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER
        the setting "USER_DB_MAX_PARAMS" to that value will use this value as a
        fallback rather than default values.

   ref/filterset
    - Purpose
    - Moving






   ref/filters
    - Table/Matrix
        - supported Lookup values, highlight the default lookup
    - Point out Which Filters cannot be declared Implicitly, e.g. ChoiceFilter -> Maybe use a Matrix?
    - Special Cases...
    - tips on how to select the correct filter

   dev/dev_testing
    - Test Project
    - Test Data
    - Run Tests
    - Benchmarking







### TOPIC GROUPED


@@@ TODO
- [ ] Highlight Supported Fields (See django-filter doc for details) - Highlight Supporting same fields
- [ ] Add limitations also to Readme.MD

@@@ CODE DOCUMENTATION
- [ ] document mixins in code properly, purpose, Inheritance Structure (Mirroring django filters) ...
